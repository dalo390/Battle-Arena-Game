I Caleb Gray, Prince Banga, and Danny Do with BlazerID cwgray, princeb, and ddo390 completed this project on my own, with no external help or information except the official Javadocs, official class textbook,
class lectures, instructor or TAs.

We understand that any use of non-sanctioned materials (e.g., stack overflow, etc.) is considered cheating and will result in a zero for this project, as well as 
reporting to the department, college, and university for further actions.

Prince overrided executeTurn and created the GUIConfiguredTurnGym.

Danny created the App and objectmonView.

Caleb changed the GUI to close when a team could no longer fight after announcing the victor and fixed half the bugs that were fixed.
